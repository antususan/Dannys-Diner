 4. Customer A is the 1st member of Danny’s Diner and his first order is curry. Gotta fulfill his curry cravings!
 5. The last item ordered by Customers A and B before they became members are sushi and curry. Does it mean both of these items are the deciding factor? It must be really delicious for them to sign up as members!

 7. Throughout Jan 2021, their points for Customer A: 860, Customer B: 940 and Customer C: 360.
